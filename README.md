# ctf_scripts
personal scripts for ctfs

To run any of these scripts from ANYWHERE you have to add them to your path. These are simple scripts and you can feel free to free to alter them to your use cases.

1.) Make a folder titled "scripts" in your home directory.

2.) Open your ~/.bashrc file and add ```export PATH=$PATH:~/scripts``` to the end. 

That's it! That's the simplest way to make these work.
